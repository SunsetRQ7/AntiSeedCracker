**Version:** 3.5.0.1 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Target:** Minecraft 26.1.2 &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Author:** SunsetRQ7_

AntiSeedCracker is a professional, multi-layer world seed protection plugin for Paper, Purpur, and Folia. It blocks every known technique a player can use to recover your world seed, protecting your server from ESP clients, ghost clients, and seed-cracking tools such as SeedCrackerX.

---

## Features

| Protection Layer | Description |
|---|---|
| **Login & Respawn Packet Spoofing** | Replaces the hashed seed in `JOIN_GAME` and `RESPAWN` network packets with a per-player cryptographically random fake seed. Operates at the Netty I/O level via PacketEvents before any client ever receives the real value. |
| **Dynamic Seed Rotation** | Periodically assigns each online player a new random fake seed (configurable interval, minimum 30 s). Only affects the network-facing hashed seed, never the generation seed. Defeats crackers that accumulate packets across multiple sessions. |
| **Seed Integrity Monitor** | Read-only watchdog that compares each world's live generation seed against its value at startup and warns in the console if it ever drifts. Never writes to the seed itself — see [Correctness & Large-Server Notes](#correctness--large-server-notes) for why. |
| **Eye of Ender Redirection** | Intercepts thrown Eyes of Ender and redirects their velocity toward a per-player fake stronghold location. Applies a ±8° angular jitter to prevent exact triangulation across repeated throws. |
| **/locate Spoofing** | Cancels `/locate` and replies with convincingly fake coordinates. Stronghold queries use the player's stable fake location for consistency. |
| **/seed Command Block** | Blocks `/seed`, `/minecraft:seed`, `/getseed`, `/worldseed`, and any extra commands configured in `config.yml` for players, console, and RCON. Also strips seed commands from tab-complete results. |
| **End Spike Randomization** | Shuffles the bedrock cap heights of all 10 End obsidian pillars at world load and after each dragon respawn cycle. Breaks the vanilla height fingerprint `{76, 79, 82 … 103}` that uniquely identifies the seed. |
| **End City Glass Replacement** | Replaces magenta stained glass in End City chunks (scanning only the structure's bounding box, not the full chunk column) with purpur blocks on first load. Prevents long-range visual fingerprinting of the distinctive glass pattern. |
| **Treasure & Explorer Map Scrambling** | Intercepts `MAP_DATA` packets and randomises the on-map position of every structure icon (buried treasure, woodland mansion, ocean monument, and others). |
| **Slime Chunk Obfuscation** *(opt-in)* | Cancels natural slime spawns in configured worlds so tools sampling spawn/no-spawn per chunk get no signal. Disables slime farms in those worlds — off by default. |
| **Structure Reconnaissance Monitor** | Detects (logs only, never blocks) when a player visits an unusual number of seed-cracking-relevant structures in a short window — the exact structure set SeedCrackerX-style tools use for bit accumulation. Structure list is fully configurable; the chunk-qualifies cache is evicted on chunk unload instead of growing for the entire server uptime. See [Threat Model](#threat-model-liquidbounce--seedcrackerx-research) below. |
| **Command Probing Monitor** | Detects (logs only, never blocks) a player triggering several blocked seed commands in a short window — a pattern consistent with a script/macro probing for a command-blocker bypass rather than one curious `/seed`. |
| **`/execute`-Wrapping Protection** | `/seed`, `/locate`, and every extra blocked command are also checked against the command an `/execute ... run ...` chain ultimately dispatches to (recursively, for nested chains), closing a well-known Bukkit command-blocker gap where `PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent` never re-fires for vanilla's internal command re-dispatch. |
| **Audit Log** | Appends every blocked command, spoofed packet, redirected Eye, and recon flag to a flat-file TSV log in `plugins/AntiSeedCracker/logs/`. Zero external dependencies — no SQLite. |

## Metrics

Anonymous usage statistics are collected via [bStats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/AntiSeedCracker/32378). This can be disabled globally in `plugins/bStats/config.yml`.

---

## Installation

1. Download `AntiSeedCracker-3.5.0.1.jar` from [Releases](../../releases/latest).
2. Place it in your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Start or restart the server.
4. Edit `plugins/AntiSeedCracker/config.yml` to your preference.
5. Run `/asc reload` to apply changes without restarting.

---

## Commands

| Command | Description | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| `/asc reload` | Reloads config and restarts all protection tasks | `antiseedcracker.admin.manage` |
| `/asc toggle <feature> [true\|false]` | Flips (or explicitly sets) one feature live — persists to `config.yml` and reloads automatically. Tab-completes feature names. | `antiseedcracker.admin.manage` |
| `/asc status` | Shows which protection layers are active | `antiseedcracker.admin.status` |
| `/asc stats` | Displays aggregate event counts from the audit log | `antiseedcracker.admin.status` |
| `/asc info` | Shows version, author, platform, and update status | `antiseedcracker.admin.status` |
| `/asc help` | Lists the subcommands the sender has permission to use | `antiseedcracker.admin.status` |

`antiseedcracker.admin` is the umbrella permission (default: op) and grants both `antiseedcracker.admin.status` (read-only) and `antiseedcracker.admin.manage` (state-changing) as children, so you can hand trusted moderators view-only access without letting them change config. Toggleable feature names for `/asc toggle`: `login`, `respawn`, `rotation`, `endspikes`, `endcities`, `locate`, `integrity`, `slime`, `recon`, `treasuremap`, `database`, `probing`.

### `modify_world` Warning

Setting `modify_world: true` for End spikes or End cities **permanently changes world data**. Spike bedrock caps are moved to shuffled positions and End City magenta glass is replaced with purpur blocks. These changes persist across restarts. Set to `false` to disable physical world modifications while keeping all other protection layers active.

---

## World Safety

AntiSeedCracker never reads, stores, or logs the real world seed. The only world modifications performed are:

- Moving bedrock cap blocks on End obsidian pillars (when `end_spikes.modify_world: true`).
- Replacing magenta stained glass in End City chunks with purpur blocks (when `end_cities.modify_world: true`).

Both modifications use `physicsUpdate: false` to prevent block-update cascades. Each chunk is tagged with a Persistent Data Container key so the modification runs **at most once per chunk** across all server restarts. No terrain, biome, or structure data outside these specific block types is ever altered.

**AntiSeedCracker never writes to a world's generation seed, at any point, for any reason.** Earlier versions did (see below) — this caused real damage and has been removed entirely.

---

## Correctness & Large-Server Notes

**Version 3.3.0 fixes a serious bug present in 3.2.0 and earlier.** The old "Plugin API Protection" feature patched the live in-memory seed field that Minecraft's own chunk generator reads, once per second, forever, on every loaded world. That field isn't a copy — it's the exact same value the vanilla decoration step (trees, ores, ravines, structure placement) re-reads *fresh for every chunk it generates*, not just once at world load. The result: any chunk decorated while that field held a fake value got seeded from randomness instead of your real seed, causing visibly broken terrain/structure generation, and the constant reflection-based writing added avoidable overhead and cross-plugin risk on busy servers.

This has been completely removed. In its place, `SeedIntegrityMonitor` only *reads* `world.getSeed()` on a low-frequency timer and logs a warning if it ever changes — it never writes to it. This was verified by booting real Paper 26.1.2 and Folia 26.1.2 servers with explicit known seeds and confirming, at the raw NBT byte level in `world_gen_settings.dat`, that the seed never drifted after extended runtime.

Other large-server changes in this release:
- `EndCityProtector` now scans only the generated structure's bounding box instead of the entire chunk column (previously up to 256 vertical blocks × 256 columns per End City chunk).
- The periodic player-seed safety-net task runs every 15s instead of every 1s (it no longer has any seed-patching work to do).

## Threat Model: LiquidBounce & SeedCrackerX Research

This release includes research into how modern cheat clients and cracking tools actually recover seeds, so protections target real techniques rather than guesses:

- **SeedCrackerX** (the dominant seed-cracking tool) primarily works by combining the *exact coordinates* of structures the player has legitimately found — shipwrecks, desert pyramids, jungle temples, swamp huts, pillager outposts, ocean monuments, igloos, and End Cities — until it has enough bits to brute-force the seed. **This is not a network exploit.** A player standing at a real structure already knows their own coordinates; no plugin can hide a player's position from themselves without breaking movement entirely. This is a fundamental limitation of any server-side plugin, not just this one — treat any tool's claim of "100% uncrackable" against this technique with skepticism.
- What we added because of this: `StructureReconMonitor` watches for the specific pattern SeedCrackerX data-gathering produces — visiting several of those exact structure types in a short time window — and logs it for admin review. It never blocks or punishes, matching this plugin's design; it just gives you visibility into likely automated cracking activity.
- **Slime-chunk sampling** is another real technique (spawn/no-spawn per chunk leaks a bit of seed information). `slime_chunk_obfuscation` (opt-in, off by default) cancels natural slime spawns in configured worlds to deny this signal — at the cost of disabling slime farms there.
- **LiquidBounce's `XRay` and `StorageESP` modules** (block/ore/chest ESP) are a **different threat entirely** — they exploit full chunk data the server must send for rendering, and have nothing to do with the world seed. This is not something a seed-protection plugin should attempt to solve by reimplementing chunk obfuscation (high risk, likely to break vanilla behavior — exactly what large-server admins told us to stop doing). **Use Paper's built-in anti-xray** (`anticheat.anti-xray` in `paper-world-defaults.yml`) for that threat class; it's mature, maintained, and the correct tool for the job. We surveyed the public source/issue trackers of LiquidBounce, Wurst, and Meteor Client directly: seed-cracking integration has been repeatedly requested against all three and never merged, and none of them ship any feature that detects or reacts to a server spoofing/rotating the hashed-seed packet field, faking stronghold triangulation, or scrambling map icons. Their ESP/X-ray modules only render blocks and entities the server already sent in chunk data — confirmed directly from LiquidBounce's own module docs — which is exactly why that threat class is out of this plugin's scope.
- Packet-level hashed-seed spoofing (login/respawn) and `/locate` spoofing still close off the older, simpler leak vectors that predate SeedCrackerX's structure-based method. **Be honest about how load-bearing this layer is, though:** the hashed seed is a narrow, low-information channel (originally just cosmetic biome-border noise), and a well-informed cracker that has enough structure-position bits can simply deprioritize or ignore an inconsistent hash rather than being blocked by it. Treat hashed-seed spoofing/rotation as raising the bar against unsophisticated tools, not as a load-bearing defense on its own — the structure-, End-spike-, and End-City-level protections matter more against a serious attacker.
- **`/execute`-wrapping bypass.** Vanilla's `/execute ... run <command>` re-dispatches its trailing command internally without re-firing `PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent` — a documented, long-standing Bukkit/Spigot architectural gap (command re-dispatch via `Server#dispatchCommand` or Brigadier's internal redirect never re-triggers that event). A command-blocker that only pattern-matches the literal typed message would let `/execute run seed` (or nested `/execute as @s run execute run seed`) straight through. **Fixed in 3.5.0**: every blocking check also recursively resolves what an `/execute` chain ultimately dispatches to before deciding whether to block it.
- **Known remaining limitation, by design:** commands issued by a **command block** or a **data-pack `/function`** never fire `PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent` at all (not even the outer event `/execute` at least still fires) — there is no supported Paper/Bukkit API hook for either. Closing this would require NMS-level hooks into Brigadier's command dispatcher, which this plugin deliberately avoids for the same reason it avoids reflection-based seed patching (see [Correctness & Large-Server Notes](#correctness--large-server-notes)): version-fragile, cross-plugin-risky code that breaks on every Minecraft update. Mitigate by restricting who can place command blocks or edit data packs (both already require elevated permissions/file access on a well-run server) rather than expecting a plugin to police vanilla mechanics with no exposed event.
- **Other anti-seed-cracker projects, for comparison.** [`akshualy/AntiSeedCracker`](https://github.com/akshualy/AntiSeedCracker) (ProtocolLib-based, Spigot 1.20.4–1.21) covers hashed-seed spoofing plus End spike/City modification, similar core scope to this plugin's packet+structure layers. [`zAntiCracker`](https://github.com/Zyralis/zAntiCracker) takes a pure behavioral-heuristic approach instead of packet spoofing — a "suspicion score" from command spam, structure-scan rate, and packet rate, with optional auto-kick; we deliberately don't kick (see Design Principles) and a patient/slow cracker script can trivially stay under rate-based thresholds, but its command-probing concept is genuinely useful as a *detection* signal, which is why 3.5.0 adds the non-punishing `command_probing_monitor`. On the **Fabric side** (a fundamentally different, server-generation-layer approach not available to Paper/Spigot plugins), [`DrexHD/SeedGuard`](https://github.com/DrexHD/SeedGuard) and [`Earthcomputer/SecureSeed`](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/SecureSeed) re-randomize or cryptographically replace the *per-feature* seeds vanilla derives from the world seed, so structure-position triangulation no longer correlates to anything real — architecturally stronger against the "unblockable" triangulation vector than any packet-layer defense, but it requires Fabric server-side and isn't something the Bukkit/Paper API exposes a hook for. If you can run Fabric, that class of plugin closes a gap this one structurally cannot.

---

## Folia Threading Model

All block mutations are dispatched to the region thread owning the relevant chunk via `RegionScheduler` (Folia) or the main thread (Paper). Packet interceptors run on the Netty I/O thread and only perform `ConcurrentHashMap` lookups. The seed rotation and player-seed safety-net tasks run on the `AsyncScheduler` (Paper/Folia).

---

## Known Bypass Mitigations

| Attack Vector | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Login/Respawn packet interception | PacketEvents HIGHEST-priority intercept |
| `/seed`, `/getseed`, `/worldseed` | `PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent` + `ServerCommandEvent` + `RemoteServerCommandEvent` blocking |
| `/execute ... run seed` (or nested) wrapping | Recursive `/execute` chain resolution before the block check — see Threat Model |
| Eye of Ender triangulation | Per-player fake stronghold + ±8° jitter |
| `/locate structure` triangulation | Spoofed coordinate output, cached per player+structure so repeated queries stay consistent |
| Treasure / explorer maps | `MAP_DATA` packet decoration scrambling, deterministic per map+icon (no visible jitter on refresh) |
| End spike height fingerprinting | Full Fisher-Yates shuffle of pillar cap heights |
| End City visual fingerprinting | Magenta glass block replacement (bounding-box scoped) |
| SeedCrackerX-style structure recon | Detection + audit logging (cannot be prevented — see Threat Model) |
| Command-blocker bypass scripting/probing | Detection + audit logging (never blocks — see Threat Model) |
| Slime-chunk seed sampling | Optional natural-spawn cancellation |
| Tab-complete exposure | `TabCompleteEvent` filtering |
| RCON seed commands | `RemoteServerCommandEvent` blocking |
| Command-block / data-pack `/function` execution | **Known limitation, not interceptable via Bukkit API** — see Threat Model |
| Block/ore ESP (XRay, StorageESP) | Out of scope — use Paper's native anti-xray |

---

## Building from Source

Requires Maven 3.6+ and **JDK 25**. The project compiles against folia-api 26.1.2 (Java 25 class files) and produces a Java 25 output jar.

```sh
# Windows (adjust to wherever your JDK 25 is actually installed, e.g. under
# "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\" for Temurin builds)
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-25
mvn clean package

# Linux / macOS
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-25
mvn clean package
```

The shaded jar is produced at `target/AntiSeedCracker-3.5.0.1.jar`. PacketEvents 2.13.0 and bStats 3.2.1 are bundled and relocated under `me.sunsetrqsv.antiseedcracker.lib`.

---

## Design Principles

- **Never punish players.** AntiSeedCracker never kicks or bans anyone — it silently feeds cheat clients useless data.
- **Never touch the real seed.** The plugin never reads, stores, transmits, or logs the actual world seed.
- **Never corrupt the world.** All optional world modifications are single-block, physics-free, idempotent, and clearly documented.
- **Fully asynchronous.** Packet work happens on Netty I/O threads; periodic tasks run on async schedulers; block mutations are dispatched to the owning region thread on Folia.
